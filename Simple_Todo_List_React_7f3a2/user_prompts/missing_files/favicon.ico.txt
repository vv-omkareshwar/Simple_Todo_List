Summary for File (Simple_Todo_List_React_7f3a2/src/components/TodoItem.js): This file defines a React component called TodoItem, which represents a single task in a todo list. It imports React and PropTypes for type checking. The component receives props for the task details, and functions for deleting, toggling, and adding inner tasks. It uses the useState hook to manage the state of the inner task input. The component renders the task text, delete button, inner task form, and a list of inner tasks if they exist. It also includes PropTypes for type checking of the props.

Key elements:
- useState hook for managing inner task input state
- handleInnerTaskSubmit function for adding new inner tasks
- Rendering of task text, delete button, and inner task form
- Conditional rendering of inner tasks list
- PropTypes for type checking of props
- Export of the TodoItem component as default

Summary for File (Simple_Todo_List_React_7f3a2/src/App.js): This App.js file is the main component of a React-based Todo List application. It manages the state for all tasks and inner tasks, handles local storage operations, and renders the main structure of the app. The component uses React hooks (useState and useEffect) for state management and side effects. It includes functions for loading and saving tasks to local storage, adding new tasks, and deleting all tasks. The main UI consists of a form for adding new tasks, a TodoList component (imported from './components/TodoList') for rendering the list of tasks, and a button to delete all tasks. The file imports the TodoList component and a CSS file for styling.
