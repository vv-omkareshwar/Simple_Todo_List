, but I cannot perform any conversion or modification on the file "omkar-portfolio-react-tsx-7f8d9/public/images/c++.png". This is an image file, not a code file. Image files like PNG (Portable Network Graphics) are binary files that contain graphical data and cannot be "converted" in the same way as source code files.

The file "c++.png" is likely an image used in the portfolio website to represent C++ programming skills or projects. It should remain as is in the "public/images" directory of the project structure.

Since there's no code to convert, I cannot provide a converted code output or list any dependencies. The image file should be used as-is in the React application, typically referenced in components like the Skills component when displaying programming language icons.

If you have any specific questions about how to use this image in the React application or if you need assistance with any actual code files, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help
