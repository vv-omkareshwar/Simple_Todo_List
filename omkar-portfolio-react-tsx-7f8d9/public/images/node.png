, but I cannot convert the file at the path "omkar-portfolio-react-tsx-7f8d9/public/images/node.png" because it is an image file (PNG format). Image files are binary and do not contain code that can be converted to another programming language.

The file "node.png" is likely an image asset used in the React application, possibly to display a Node.js logo or icon. In this case, no conversion is necessary or possible. The image file should remain as-is in the public/images directory of the project.

Since there's no code to convert, I cannot provide a converted code block or dependencies. However, I can confirm that this file should be kept in its current location and format within the project structure.

If you have any specific questions about how this image is used in the React application or if you need assistance with any other files in the project, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help
