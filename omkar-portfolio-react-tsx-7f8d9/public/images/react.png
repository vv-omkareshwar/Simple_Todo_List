, but I cannot convert the file at `omkar-portfolio-react-tsx-7f8d9/public/images/react.png` because it is an image file, not a code file. Image files like PNG (Portable Network Graphics) are binary files and do not contain code that can be converted to another programming language.

The file `react.png` is likely an image asset used in the React application, possibly as an icon or logo. It should remain as is in the `public/images` directory of the project.

Since there's no code to convert, the output format for converted code and dependencies is not applicable in this case.

If you need any changes or conversions related to how this image is used in the React application, please provide the relevant code files that reference this image, and I'd be happy to assist with those conversions
